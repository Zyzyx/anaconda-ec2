Only F18 works out of the box with these.

RHEL6/CentOS 6 works but cloud-init is, for the moment, broken.
We need to push an update to EPEL.

The ubuntu preseed here actually works but I don't yet know how
to add the needed post-install script bits to create a working pvgrub
menu.lst file.  Help would be appreciated.
